As shown in the pdf on the class website, the problem is that the coverage, represented by rectangles, cannot overlap each other, and if a rectangle is initially overlapping another, it is trimmed so that it is a rectangle which covers the maximum area.\n",

This confirms my hypothesis that the beginning rectangles quickly cover the open space. The later rectangles cover less area since they are trimmed to fit within the notches and gaps the beginning rectangles leave behind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to 10 rectangles, the percent area covered goes to ~60-80% but has diminishing returns as the number of rectangles increases. To get above ~80% covered, we will usually need 20 communication towers and to get 100% area covered, we need 25+ towers."

    "Throughout the project, there was the issue of the time it took to run the code, especially for finding the average area. Obviously, to get a better average I would have needed to execute the main() function many more times, but I only executed it 50 times to get the average number of communication towers to fill the area, and only 20 times each sample for seeing how much area a certain number of rectangles take up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another limitation is that the area is a square. This is a trade-off between the complexity in the code and the possibility of the different variations in area size. I decided that making area a square doesn't limit the analysis too much because the window can also vary in size but is limited to being a square. A rectangle window wouldn't be too different from a square window in terms of this problem."
